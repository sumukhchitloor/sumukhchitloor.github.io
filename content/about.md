Hemlo! I'm Sumukh Chitloor (@t0x1n), a security engineer currently serving as a **Data & Cloud Security Engineer** at CRED, where I help safeguard cutting edge fintech systems for millions of users. My journey began with an obsessive curiosity about "how things work under the hood" and evolved into a career at the intersection of breaking things and building them back to outsmart threats and build resilient defenses

## When I'm Not in Security Mode

- **Gaming:** Big RPG fan, love getting lost in massive open worlds and complex storylines (currently have like 5 games in my backlog that I swear I'll finish someday)
- **Reading:** Always trying to build a consistent reading habit (emphasis on trying lol). Mix of non fiction for learning new stuff and fiction when I want my brain to chill
- **Travel:** Exploring new places whenever I can escape the laptop. There's something refreshing about being somewhere with zero WiFi and actually disconnecting. I have completed tons of trek including **Kedarkantha**
- **Cricket:** Massive fan, I can drop everything to watch a good match. Nothing beats the drama of a close Test match or a T20 thriller
